If we can find a polynomial time algorithm for determining whether or not a given sentence of propositional logic is sometimes true,
or if we can show that no such algorithm exists, then we will resolve the $P=NP$ problem.[^1]

[^1]: A First Course in Logic - An Introduction to Model Theory, Proof Theory, Computability, and Complexity.

We show that, in a certain setting (namely, graph thery) the complexity classes of $P$ and $NP$ (and others) can be defined as logics.
For example, Fagin's Theorem states that (for graphs) $NP$ contains precisely those decision problems that can be expressed in second-order
exsitential logic. So the $N = NP$ problem and related questions can be rephrased as questions of whether or not two logics are equivalent.

# Sets and strctures

We assume that the reader is familiar with the fundamental notion of _a set_. We use standard set notation:

- $x \in A$ means $x$ is an element of set $A$,
- $x \notin A$ means $x$ is not an element of $A$,
- $\varnothing$ denotes the unique set containing no elements,
- $A \subset B$ means every element of set $A$ is also an element of set $B$,
- $A \cup B$ denotes the union of sets $A$ and $B$,
- $A \cap B$ denotes the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, and
- $A \times B$ denotes the Cartesian product of sets $A$ and $B$.

# Propositional Logic

## What is propositional logic?

In propositional logic, atomic formulas are propositions. Any assertion will do. For example,

- A = "Aristotle is dead"
- B = "Barcelona is on the Seine

are atomic formulas. Atomic formulas are the building blocks used to construct sentences. In any logic, a sentence is regarded as a particular
type of formula. In propositional logic, there is no distinction between these two terms. We use "formula" and "sentence" interchangeably.

...

In fact that, the content of the propositions is not relevant to propositional logic. Henceforth, aotmic formulas are denoted only by capital
letters $A$, $B$, $C$, ... (possibly with subscript) without referring to what these propositions actually say. The veracity of these formulas
does not concern us. **Propositional logic is not the study of truth, but of the relationship between the truth of one statement and that of another.**

$\neg$ for "not", $\land$ for "and", $\lor$ for "or", $\implies$ for "implies", and $\iff$ for "if and only if".

**Rules:**

- (R1): If $F$ is a formula, then $\neg F$ is also a formula.
- (R2): If $F$ and $G$ are formulas, then $(F\land G)$ is a formula.

**Definition 1.2** A finite string of symbols is a _formula_ of propositional logic if and only if it's built up from atomic formulas
by repeated application of rules (R1) and (R2).

- (C1): If $F$ or $(F)$ is a formula, then we view $F$ and $(F)$ as the same formula.

The use of (C1) also requires care in defining the notion of "subformula". A subformula of a formula $F$ (viewed as a string of symbols)
is a substring of $F$ that is itself a formula. However, because of (C1), not every such substring is a subformula. So we do not want to take
this property as the definition of "subformula". Instead, we define "subformula" as follows.

**Definition 1.4** The following rules define the _subformula_ of a formula.

- Any formula is a subformula of itself.
- Any subformula of $F$ is also a subformula of $\neg F$.
- Any subformula of $F$ or $G$ is also a subformula of $(F \land G)$.

**Example 1.5** Let $A$ and $B$ be atomic and let $F$ be the formula $\neg(\neg A \land \neg B)$
The formula $A \land \neg B$ occurs as a substring of $F$, but it's not a subformula of $F$. There is no way
to build the formula $F$ from the formula $A \land \neg B$. The subformulas of $F$ are $A$, $B$, $\neg A$, $\neg B$,
$(\neg A \land \neg B)$, and $\neg(\neg A \land \neg B)$.

| $A$ | $B$ | $\neg A$ | $\neg B$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1        | 1        |

**Definition 1.6** The symbol $\lor$ is defined as follows: for any formulas $F$ and $G$, $(F \lor G)$ is an abbreviation for $\neg (\neg F \land \neg G)$. The
formula $(F \lor G)$ is called the _disjunction_ of $F$ and $G$.

**Definition 1.7** The symbol $\implies$ and $\iff$ are defined as follows:

- $(F \implies G)$ abbr. $(G \lor \neg F)$, and
- $(F \iff G)$ abbr. $((F \implies G) \land (G \implies F))$.

### 1.2 Validity, satisfiability, and contradiction

Let $S = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ be a set of atomic formulas. Let $\digamma(S)$ be the set of all formulas that can be built from the atomic formulas in $S$.

**Definition 1.9** An _assignment_ of $S$ is a function $A: S \mapsto \{0,1\}$.

...

Let $A$ be an assignment of $S$ and let $F$ be a formula. If $A(F) = 1$, then we say $F$ _holds_ under assignment $A$. Equivalently, we say $A$ _models_
$F$. We write $A \models F$ to denote this concept.

**Definition 1.11** A formula is _valid_ if it holds under every assignment. We use $ \models F$ to denote this. A valid formula is called a _tautology_.
The formula $(C \lor \neg C)$ from the previous example is a tautology.

**Definition 1.13** A formula is _satisfiable_ if it holds under some assignment.

**Definition 1.14** A formula is _unsatisfiable_ if it holds under no assignment. An unsatisfiable formula is called a _contradiction_.

The formula $(C \land \neg C)$ is a contradiction.

Suppose that we want to determine whether or not a given formula is valid. This is an example of a _decision problem_. A decision problem is any problem
that, given certain input, asks a question to be answered with a "yes" or a "no". Given formula $F$ as input, we may ask "Is $F$ valid?". We refer to
this as the _validity problem_. Likewise, we may ask "Is $F$ satisfiable?", and refer to this the _satisfiable problem_.

...

Theoretically, we can determine whether any formula $F$ is valid, satisfiable or unsatisfiable by looking at a truth table. Unfortunately, this is not always
an efficient method. If $F$ contains $n$ atomic formulas, then there are $2^n$ rows to compute in the truth table for $F$. So if $F$ happens to have, say,
$23$ atomic formulas, then computing a truth table is not feasible. One of our aims in this chapter is to find alternative methods for resolving the validity
and satisfiability problems that avoid truth tables. More generally, our aim is to contrive various ways of determining whether or not a given formula is
a consequence of a given set of formulas. This is a central problem of any logic.

### Consequence and equivalence

We now introduce the fundamental notion of consequence. First, we define what it means for one formula to be a consequence of another. Later in this section,
we similarly define what it means for a formula to be a consequence of a _set_ of formulas.

**Definition 1.18** Formula $G$ is a _consequence_ of formula $F$ if for every assignment $A$, if $A \models F$ then $A \models G$. We denote this by $F \models G$.

- $A \models F$ means that $A(F)=1$. We read this as "$A$ models $F$".
- $G \models F$ means every assignment that models $G$ also models $F$. This is, $F$ is a consequence of $G$.
- $\models F$ means every assignment models $F$. That is, $F$ is a tautology.

**Proposition 1.19** For any formula $F$ and $G$, $G$ is a consequence of $F$ if and only if $F \implies G$ is a tautology.

$$F \models G \iff \models (F \implies G)$$

### 1.4 Formal proofs

A logic, by definition, has rules for reducing the truth of one sentence from that of another. These rules yield a system of formal proof. In this section, we describe
such a proof system for propositional logic.

A _proof system_ consists of a basic rules for derivations. These rules allow us to deduce formulas from sets of formulas.
It may take serveral steps to derive a given formula $G$ from a set of formulas $\digamma$, where each "step" is an application of one of the basic rules.
The list of these forms a _formal proof_ of $G$ from $\digamma$.

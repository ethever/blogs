## Expanding Beyond Stables: Introducing Origin DeFi

### Origin DeFi: A Yield-Bearing Token Ecosystem

In DeFi, whales have the upper hand. Earning yield can be a tedious task,
burdened by hefty gas fees and an array of complex applications.

In 2020, Origin sought to make yield accessible for all by launching the first
yield-bearing stablecoin, OUSD. We're now taking the next step forward,
offering seamless, accessible, and elevated yield on ether.

Despite how far Origin has come, we've barely scratched the surface of our
ultimate vision for our yield-bearing token ecosystem. As we expand our
product suite to incorporate Origin Ether, it's fitting that our brand
reflects the cutting-edge platforms under its umbrella.

_Welcome to the world of Origin DeFi_ - a groundbreaking ecosystem for
yield generation in stables and beyond.

### Best-In-Class Governance

_Origin DeFi Governance(OGV)_ serves as the governance and value-accrual
token at the heart of Origin DeFi.

Formerly Origin Dollar Governance, OGV has been utilized as the governance
token for the Origin Dollar protocol. With Origin DeFi, OGV's utility is
expanding to govern both OUSD and OETH.

OGV further innovates the vote-escrow token model pioneered by Curve Finance.
Holders can stake their OGV on a time horizon of up to four years in exchange
for veOGV, which carries voting and economics rights. veOGV holders
simultaneously enjoy generous passive yield from their staked OGV.

As part of our commitment to user autonomy, all of OUSD and OETH's strategy
allocations are decided on a weekly basis via governance votes. This model
has been carefully honed since its initial launch with impressive results.
At the time of writing, nearly 80% if all OGV is currently staked, with stakers
reaping 29.77% variable APY.

### Origin Ether: Stack ETH Faster

At Origin, we pride ourselves on our ability to adapt rapidly to harness
fresh opportunities to their full potential. In the wake of Ethereum's
merge to Beacon Chain, ETH staking has exploded in volume, carving out a
new sector teeming with activity.

Origin Ether(OETH) has been expressly built to harness this yield to its
full potential, with the same seamless usability enjoyed by users of OUSD.

OETH takes form as an ETH staking yield aggregator, and it generates outsided
yield throught meticulous strategies. The protocol is fully collateralized
by ETH and a basket of blue-chip liquid staking derivatives(LSDs): Lido's stETH,
Rocketpool's rETH, and Frax's frxETH.

Holding these LSDs ensures that, a minimum, OETH's yield keeps pace with
staking services. This design also provides a unique opportunity for stETH,
rETH, and frxETH holders to compound their returns.

OETH's strategies turbocharge these returns. In addition to holding LSDs,
frxETH reserves are staked to Frax to generate validator rewards. Beyond
LSD exposure, OETH utilizes liquidty provision and rewards tokens to
further enhance yield for users.

At launch, OETH will provide liquidity via Convex and Curve to earn trading
fees and CRV/CVX token rewards. The protocol participates in the Curve
wars by utilizing Origin's CRV and CVX treasury to earn boosted yield for
holders.

As always, we're planning with the future in mind. Origin Ether will expand
its LP strategies to other premier AMMs as trading volume grows in the LSD
sector. We've already built out a highly efficient Uniswap V3 market making
strategy in preparation for this growth, which will be applied to Origin
Dollar very soon.

OETH's security is being held to the highest standards possible.

While OETH borrows most of its codebases from OUSD, there's no room
for complacency at Origin. All of OETH's smart contracts will undergo
comprehensive audits conducted by OpenZeppelin. Additionally, Narya will
conduct AI security testing on the protocol.

Origin Ether is launching soon - keep your eyes on [oeth.com](oeth.com)
to be first in line.

### Origin Dollar: A Next Generation Stablecoin

Years of innovation have cemented Origin Dollar's (OUSD) positioning as
the most seamless and rewarding stablecoin the space has to offer.

As DeFi veterans, our team is well-attuned to the challenges users face
when interacting with on-chain protocols. Generally, staking can be a
painfull exercise. Users are often forced to surrender control of their
capital during lock-up periods, and high gas fees make it prohibitive for
many users to claim rewards or stake assets.

This complex process flow is incredibly inefficient. New adopters are
reasonably deterred by the unnecessary high barriers to entry, while stakers
are forced to pay regular gas fees and dedicate excessive time to their
investments.

Like OETH, staking OUSD does not require any lock-up. Users mint OUSD by
depositing any of the space's three most widely used stablecoins - USDC,
USDT, and DAI. Once minted, OUSD can be transacted like any other stablecoin,
remainning liquid while earning yield.

Users enjoy unparalleled yield disbursed directly to their wallets in
proportion to their OUSD holdings. No gas fees, no lockups, and elevated
APYs compared to direct lending or liquidty provision.

OUSD evidences our commitment to user empowerment and robust, innovation
design. The protocol's smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by
[OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/), [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), and [Trailofbits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).
Additionally, OUSD's codebase is fully open source, allowing the community to
monitor and flag any vulnerabilities. Don't just take our world for it --
view all metries for yourself via OUSD's advanced [analytics page](https://www.ousd.com/analytics).

These measures have rendered Origin Dollar one of only six cryptocurrencies in
existence to receive a AAA rating from digital asset coverage firm InsurAce.

### A DeFi Ecosystem For Everyone

Underpinned by [OGV's](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/origin-dollar-governance/)
unparalleled governance, Origin Dollar and Origin Ether offer robust platforms
for users to enjoy the full benefits of DeFi - from fresh adopters to on-chain
veterans, DAOs, protocols, and institutions.

Both tokens rebase daily, compounding yield directly to your wallet. You
retain full control of your captial. No lock-ups, no compromise. Origin
DeFi represents more than the tokens offered at present -- we're planting
the seeds to disrupt the way DeFi yield is earned on a seismic scale.

Watch this space.
